# Docker React Go PostreSQL

Just somewhere for me to experiment with the above technologies in a Dockerized environment.

## TODO
[✅] Dockerize PostgreSQL
* Make sure that this is accessible from TablePlus.

[✅] Dockerize Golang Server
* Must be accessible on local host so that it can be visiting in the browser / accessed from the frontend
can serve requests to the frontend.

[✅] Dockerize React Frontend

[ ] Connect the 3 Dockerized applications together
* All 3 parts of the application should be able to communicate with each other without issue.
